dependencies:
  - python=3.12
    # Note: Ansible requires a Python version that is 3.9 or higher. The
    # community.docker.docker_container Ansible module requires a Python
    # version greater than 3.9. We install Python 3.12 because it is the latest
    # at this time. There is little reason to bump this version, but you should
    # feel free to bump it if you need a feature that's only available for a
    # newer version.

  # TASK [Specify the host provisioning requirements]
  
  - ansible

    # TASK [Specify the pip requirements]
    # 
    # Note: We prefer to specify the Conda package unless (a) no Conda package
    # exists or (b) the Conda package would install a binary that we prefer to
    # manage via apt an repository package.
    
    - docker
      # required_by: community.docker Ansible modules
      #
      # Note: We choose the pip package because we prefer to use the Docker
      # CLI tool binaries that are provided by the Docker apt repository.
